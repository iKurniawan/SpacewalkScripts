CEFS: CentOS Errata for Spacewalk
=================================

CentOS Errata for Spacewalk based on Steve Meier errata import tool - http://cefs.steve-meier.de
This fine piece of software allows you to import errata information from the CentOS-Announce mailing list into your Spacewalk-Server.
For security announcements details from Red Hat (RHSA) can be imported optionally.

I just made this bash shell script easier to use for me, please read the code before you use it blindly.
